# Hospital-Management
Our project provides the basic functionalities needed to handle hospital appointment system.It is
a menu-driven program.It enables doctors and admins to view and handle appointment
schedules if required.
1) If the patient is new to hospital, he/she has to fill up the details such as name, age, blood
group, gender, appointment name, phone number and address of himself/herself. Then the
patient is asked if it is an emergency case or not. After that, the patient is asked to select one of
the health issues and then the priority is set to the patient. According to the health issue, a
specific doctor is assigned to the patient.
2) If an existing patient revisits the hospital then, he/she has to input the name and then select
the health issue and the date has to be input again and the database will be updated
accordingly. Thus the doctor is assigned.
3) There is also an option to search the patient by name and display their details.
4) Another option given to explore is ‘display patient details’ which displays a list of patients with
their respective information with the doctor’s information to whom the patient is assigned to.
5) If the delete option is selected then the patient has been discharged from the hospital.
6) Then the last option is to exit out of the program.
